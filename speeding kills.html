Speed. We all know we like going fast but in some places yes and others NO. <br>
<b> Because every year nowadays 1.24 out of 100,000,000 cars get into fatal accidents. Its a low number but still. </b> <br>
Ay its me Beatzy Truck and I believe speeding is a very bad thing. One time I was going 101 in a 60 zone and BAM. My little party was over.
